## Project Structure
This project is part of a larger application with components in multiple locations:

1. **Backend (FastAPI)**: `/home/laki-edward/PycharmProjects/Fitness_app/`
   - Contains all API endpoints and business logic
   - Main file: `app/main.py`
   - API definitions in `app/routers/`

2. **Android UI**: `/home/laki-edward/StudioProjects/FitnessApp/`
   - Kotlin-based Android application
   - API service: `app/src/main/java/com/example/fitnessapp/api/ApiService.kt`

3. **Web UI (Angular)**: `/home/laki-edward/IdeaProjects/fitsense/`
   - Angular-based web application
   - Currently implementing API services

## Common Tasks
- To understand API endpoints: Check `ApiService.kt` in the Android app or router files in the backend
- To implement Angular services: Reference the endpoints in `ApiService.kt` and create corresponding services
- To understand the project structure: Check `PROJECT_MAP.md` in each project root

## Angular Project Structure
- `src/app/core/services/api/` - API services for communicating with the backend
- `src/app/core/models/` - TypeScript interfaces matching backend data models
- `src/app/pages/` - Angular components for different pages of the application
- `src/app/shared/` - Shared components, directives, and pipes

## Development Workflow
1. Implement API services in Angular that match the endpoints defined in the backend
2. Create TypeScript interfaces that match the backend data models
3. Update components to use the API services instead of mock data
4. Test the integration between the Angular app and the backend API

## Key Files
- `src/main.ts` - Entry point for the Angular application
- `src/app/app.ts` - Main application component
- `src/app/app.routes.ts` - Application routing configuration
