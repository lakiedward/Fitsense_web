# Changes Made to Implement Option 1

## Problem

The Angular frontend application was configured to connect to a local backend server at `http://localhost:8000`, but the actual backend is deployed on Railway at `https://fitnessapp-production-60ee.up.railway.app`. This caused connection issues when trying to use the application in development mode.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Development Environment Configuration

The development environment configuration file (`environment.ts`) has been updated to point to the Railway URL instead of localhost:

```typescript
// Before
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000'
};

// After
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'https://fitnessapp-production-60ee.up.railway.app'
};
```

This change implements Option 1 from the previous solution, which was to update the development environment configuration to use the deployed backend on Railway instead of trying to connect to a local backend server.

### Content-Type Interceptor

The Content-Type interceptor was already properly implemented and registered. This interceptor ensures that all HTTP requests from the Angular application have the 'Content-Type: application/json' header set, which is important for the backend to correctly parse the request body.

## Expected Result

With these changes, the Angular application should now be able to connect to the backend deployed on Railway when running in development mode. This eliminates the need to run a local backend server and ensures that the application can properly communicate with the deployed backend.
