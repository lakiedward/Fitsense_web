# FitSense Web Signup Flow Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement an Android-style UI for the signup flow in the FitSense web application. The implementation closely follows the design patterns and user experience of the Android application to provide a consistent experience across platforms.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Visual Design

- **Gradient Background**: Implemented a purple-blue gradient background matching the Android app's color scheme (#6366F1, #8B5CF6, #A855F7)
- **Card-Based Layout**: Created a card-based layout with rounded corners at the top
- **Improved Typography**: Updated font weights and sizes for better readability and visual hierarchy
- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Applied the primary color (#6366F1) consistently across all interactive elements

### 2. Improved Form Elements

- **Enhanced Input Fields**: Redesigned input fields with rounded corners, better focus states, and proper spacing

- **Card-Style Selection Options**: Implemented card-style selection options for gender, sports, and plan length with improved visual feedback
- **Better Error Messages**: Enhanced error message display with warning icons and better visual styling

### 3. Multi-Step Flow Enhancements

### 4. Functional Improvements
